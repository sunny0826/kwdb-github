**KWDB is a distributed multi-model database designed for AIoT scenarios and incubated by the OpenAtom Foundation**.​​ Originating from Inspur's KaiwuDB project, it supports the concurrent creation of time-series and relational databases within the same instance and the integrated processing of multi-model data. KWDB can process time-series data with high efficiency. It supports tens of millions of device connections, millions of data points written per second, and hundreds of millions of data points read per second. It features stability & security, high availability, and easy maintenance.

**It is mainly used in fields such as IoT, energy, power, IoV (Internet of Vehicles), smart government, IT operation management, and securities.**  KWDB is dedicated to offer a comprehensive platform for data storage, management, and analysis across various industries, supporting enterprises in their digital transformation and unlocking greater value from their data at lower costs.
